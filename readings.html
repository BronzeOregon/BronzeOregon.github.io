            <h3>Spiritual Services:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Spiritual Cleansing Ritual:</p>
                    <p>Usual time frame is 4 to 5 hours. Consultation first via Skype or over the phone.
                        To determine the level of cleansing required. This service is tailored to the individual for their needs.
                        Included is personal consultation, items created and crafted for you to use along with my ritual work.
                        This creates stronger cleansing and helps remove blocks, negativity or any hexes.
                        We will connect again to share results and follow-up steps if needed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cord Cutting and Separation Ritual:</p>
                    <p>This specific service varies on the level you require of the separation.
                        Ritual and preparation of this service varies from 6-8. All the tools, products are hand-crafted for optimal efficacy.
                        There is a personal consultation via Skype, phone or in person. This allows a greater understanding of the needs required by you.
                        There are many moving parts for this ritual service. We will connect afterward, and I will share photos and results.
                        We will also schedule one more follow up. For advice and further steps if necessary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spiritual Blessing and Prayers:</p>
                    <p>This specific service is highly involved and requires lots of extra energy and channeling blessings and prayers towards you.
                        First there will be a personal consultation. This will make clear what is required to assist you in what you are hoping for.
                        The overall length of this service is over a three-day period. After this ritual is completed, we  will connect again and results will be shared with some photos as well.</p>

            <h3>Reading Types/Services:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Traditional Mediumship Reading:</p>
                    <p>I like to schedule for 1 hour. Readings usually last closer to an hour and a half.
                        We connect over Zoom,Skype or telephone. Whichever you are most comfortable with.
                        You can hold the person in your thoughts who you would like to come through.
                        I can not guarantee who steps forward, yet we have time for hopefully several loved ones stepping forward and sharing messages. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Psychic Readings:</p>
                    <p>Scheduling for 30 minute appointments. Unlimited questions.
                        I will be using my claircognizance and clairvoyance abilities to assist you in finding some of the answers you seek.
                        However, even though I am very accurate, potential future outcomes are possibilities.
                        We have Free Will and can make choices to change future outcomes.
                        These readings are done in person, over Zoom, Skype or telephone.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Tarot Readings:</p>
                    <p>3 card pulls, 7 card pulls and more advanced in depth layouts are possible.
                        These can be scheduled via Zoom or I will provide photos of cards and a written, descriptive report of your reading. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pendulum Readings:</p>
                    <p>These are 30-minute readings, utilizing one of the pendulums (that I feel called to use) that will provide the most accurate connection to your guides.
                        There are unlimited questions during your 30-minute seating. </p>
