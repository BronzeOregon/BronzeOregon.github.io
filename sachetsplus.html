    <h2>Sachets</h2>
    <p>
        Sachets have been a part of metaphysical and spiritual rituals and arts for centuries. Commonly comprised of herbs, roots, flowers
    and oils along with a base powder, these can be used to dust paperwork, sprinkle on candles, or ward your home.
    </p>
    <h3>Candles</h3>
    <p>
        Spell and prayer candles are prepared primarily with mind to the intent of the user. Selecting the correct candle is a
        matter of determining the appropriate color, herbs, anointing oils, etchings/writings and more based upon the end goal.
        Typically, I use candles for my altars and specific rituals, such as a cord-cutting ritual.
    </p>
    <h2>Stones</h2>
    <p>
        Various stones and crystals are used as foci when working in the metaphysical realm. It is believed that many can resonate
        with individuals on a personal level, and while there are too many stones to go over in detail here, we offer a wide variety
        including jewelry with stones and crystals set in them for everyday wear.
