        <h2>Tarot: A Short History</h2>
        <p>Tarot is a divinatory practice first established in the 19th century, building upon the symbolic nature of the game as
        first established as early as the 15th century in Italy. A tarot deck consists of 78 cards, divided into the Major Arcana,
        consisting of 22 cards, and the Minor Arcana, composing the remainder of the 56 cards.</p>
        <p>For the symbology behind the Major Arcana, please see the table below.</p>
        <div style="height: 600px; overflow: auto;">

                    the magnitude of life's challenges, as well as the potential he holds. When The Fool comes up in a Tarot reading,
                    you are encouraged to take on his open, willing energy and embrace all that lies ahead of you without worry.</td>

                    to us here in the real world. When The Hierophant comes up in your Tarot reading, you're encouraged to follow the rules, and to find a spiritual

                    However, this is just as much a card about your values and decisions. You may find The Lovers come up when you are at a crossroads.
